### TODO:

Use the capabilities of your sequencer to implement the ADPS9960 protocol and control the sensor.

### Terminate
Don't have time to complete it. 
A possible way to implement it is to integrate the `Pico-examples/pio/i2c` example into the sequencer with a corresponding write/read address according to APDS9960's datasheet.
